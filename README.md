# An MCP server for building BioCypher knowledge graphs with copilot assistance

> [!NOTE]
> This is an incomplete prototype for demonstration purposes.

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for assisting with BioCypher workflows. This server provides hierarchical tools to help LLM agents create BioCypher adapters for any data source.

## Features

- **Streamable HTTP Transport**: Full MCP protocol support with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Hierarchical Tool Structure**: Navigate through BioCypher workflows with structured guidance
- **BioCypher Adapter Creation Workflow**: Complete 5-phase framework for creating adapters from any data source
- **Project Creation Guidance**: Verify existing directories and get scripted cookiecutter instructions
- **Adaptive Implementation Process**: Step-by-step guidance for analyzing data sources and implementing appropriate adapter strategies
- **Implementation Patterns**: Reusable patterns for field mapping, conditional extraction, and progressive fallback
- **Decision Guidance**: AI-powered recommendations based on data characteristics

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the MCP server (stdio transport by default; pass --transport http for HTTP mode)
uv run python -m biocypher_mcp.main

# Or run the web server with REST API endpoints
uv run python -m biocypher_mcp.web_server
```

#### Using with MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Add the following configuration to your MCP settings (typically `mcp.json`):

**Option 1: Connect to Remote Service** (for use only, not development)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "biocypher-mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.biocypher.org/mcp",
      "transport": "http"
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Local Development** (using uv)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "biocypher-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "python", "-u", "-m", "biocypher_mcp.main"],
      "workingDirectory": "/path/to/biocypher-mcp",
      "env": { "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1" }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/biocypher-mcp` with the actual path to your cloned repository.

**Option 3: Local Development** (using virtual environment)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "biocypher-mcp": {
      "command": "/path/to/biocypher-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-u", "-m", "biocypher_mcp.main"],
      "workingDirectory": "/path/to/biocypher-mcp",
      "env": { "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Deployment

The project includes both a `Dockerfile` (for building the container image) and `docker-compose.yml` (for orchestrating services). Two services are available:

- **`biocypher-mcp`** (production): Runs on port 8000 with HTTP transport, suitable for production deployment
- **`biocypher-mcp-dev`** (development): Runs on port 8001 with HTTP transport and hot reload (source code mounted as volume)

```bash
# Build and run production service (port 8000)
docker-compose up -d biocypher-mcp

# Or run development version with hot reload (port 8001)
docker-compose up -d biocypher-mcp-dev

# Check status
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs biocypher-mcp

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

**Note:** Both services use HTTP transport by default. The production service uses the Dockerfile's default CMD, while the dev service mounts your local `src/` directory for live code changes.

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools:

### Core Workflow Tools
- **`get_available_workflows`** - List all available BioCypher workflows
- **`get_adapter_creation_workflow`** - Get detailed adapter creation workflow
- **`get_phase_guidance`** - Get step-by-step guidance for specific workflow phases
- **`get_implementation_patterns`** - Get reusable implementation patterns
- **`get_decision_guidance`** - Get AI-powered recommendations based on data characteristics

### Project Creation Tools
- **`check_project_exists`** - Show the expected cookiecutter layout and instructions for handling missing projects
- **`get_cookiecutter_instructions`** - Provide scripted, non-interactive cookiecutter commands and defaults

### Configuration Tools
- **`get_schema_configuration_guidance`** - Get guidance on BioCypher schema configuration
- **`get_resource_management_guidance`** - Get guidance on resource management and caching
- **`validate_schema_config`** - Validate a `schema_config.yaml` against the official BioCypher schema configuration rules (from [biocypher/biocypher](https://github.com/biocypher/biocypher)). Accepts a file path or raw YAML content and reports blocking errors (e.g. invalid `represented_as`, inheritance loops, mismatched list lengths that silently drop data) and warnings (typos in field names, deprecated fields, missing `input_label`).

## API Endpoints

### MCP Streamable HTTP Transport (main.py)

The primary MCP server provides streamable HTTP transport at the root endpoint:

- `POST /` - MCP protocol endpoint (streamable HTTP with SSE)
- Supports all MCP protocol methods: `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, etc.

### REST API Endpoints (web_server.py)

The web server provides REST API endpoints for traditional HTTP clients:

- `GET /` - Root endpoint with API overview
- `GET /workflows` - Available workflows
- `GET /workflows/adapter-creation` - Adapter creation workflow details
- `GET /phases/{phase_number}` - Phase-specific guidance
- `GET /patterns` - Implementation patterns
- `GET /patterns/{pattern_type}` - Specific patterns
- `POST /decision-guidance` - Decision guidance
- `POST /project/check` - Validate whether a BioCypher project already exists at a path
- `GET /project/cookiecutter-instructions` - Retrieve scripted cookiecutter guidance
- `POST /schema/validate` - Validate `schema_config.yaml` YAML content against the BioCypher schema rules (accepts raw `schema_config_content` only; file-path validation is available via the MCP/stdio tool, not over HTTP)
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation

## Usage Examples

### Preparing a BioCypher Project

```python
from biocypher_mcp.main import check_project_exists, get_cookiecutter_instructions

# Inspect the expected cookiecutter layout for your target directory
structure = check_project_exists("/path/to/project")
print(structure["expected_structure"])
print(structure["instruction_if_not_exists"])

# Retrieve scripted cookiecutter instructions and defaults
instructions = get_cookiecutter_instructions()
print(instructions["usage"]["non_interactive_mode"]["command_template"])
```

### Next Steps After Running Cookiecutter

1. Run the printed command (fill in project-specific values) to generate the project
2. Navigate to the new directory and install dependencies (`uv sync` or `poetry install`)
3. Implement your adapter under `src/<package_name>/adapters/`
4. Execute your pipeline, e.g. `python create_knowledge_graph.py`

## Development

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/biocypher/biocypher-mcp.git
cd biocypher-mcp

# Install development dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Architecture

The project provides two server implementations:

1. **main.py**: MCP streamable HTTP transport server (primary)
   - Uses FastMCP with streamable HTTP transport
   - Mounted at root path (`/`)
   - Designed for MCP clients like Cursor

2. **web_server.py**: REST API server (secondary)
   - Provides traditional REST endpoints
   - Useful for web applications and testing
   - Can run alongside the main server on different ports
